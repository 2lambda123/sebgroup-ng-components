## Reference

This component is based on a modified directive coming from [ng2-charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-charts) source code, which itself is based on [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org), and as chartjs configuration is extandable via plugins, we have implemented the annotations via [chartjs-plugin-annotation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chartjs-plugin-annotation). Further you should be able to add more plugin and pass new configrations via `options` property

## footnote

1. Supported charts: `line`, `bar`, `horizontalBar`, `pie`, `doughnut`, `polarArea`, `radar`
